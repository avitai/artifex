# Text Compression with Generative Models

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    This example is planned for a future release. Check back for updates on text compression implementations.

## Overview

This example will demonstrate:

- Neural text compression
- Learned entropy coding
- VAE-based text compression
- Rate-distortion optimization

## Planned Features

- Latent space text representation
- Arithmetic coding integration
- Compression ratio vs. quality trade-offs
- Streaming compression
