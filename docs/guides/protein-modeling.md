# Protein Modeling Guide

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    This guide is being developed. Check back for comprehensive protein modeling documentation.

## Overview

Learn about protein structure prediction and generation:

- Protein sequence encoding
- Structure prediction models
- SE(3) equivariant architectures
- Protein folding with generative models

## Key Concepts

### Sequence Representation

Amino acid sequences and their embeddings.

### Structure Prediction

Predicting 3D coordinates from sequences.

### Equivariance

SE(3) equivariant operations for proper geometric handling.
