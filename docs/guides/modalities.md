# Modalities Guide

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    This guide is being developed. Check back for comprehensive modality documentation.

## Overview

Learn about Artifex's modality system:

- Image modality features

## Available Modalities

### Image

Convolutional architectures, FID/IS metrics, image-specific augmentations.

### Text

Tokenization, transformer architectures, perplexity metrics.

### Audio

Spectrograms, MFCCs, audio-specific preprocessing.

### Protein

Sequence encoding, structure handling, biological metrics.

### Geometric

Point clouds, meshes, SE(3) equivariant processing.
